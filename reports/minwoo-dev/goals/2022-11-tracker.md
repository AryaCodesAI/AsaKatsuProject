## Log

1. **2022-11-20** - First day, created a branch minwoo from main branch develop of the AsaKatsu Project. Gonna complete at least one pull request today. Ticked the completed days so far of the 100 Days of Code challenge.
2. **2022-11-21** - Second day of using GitHub, had trouble updating my local copy (fork) of the main branch so it will be the same as the main, used merge upstream command to update; will look more into the commands used in this platform. Completed the day 38 of the 100 days coding challenge and I could pretty much say I still have a lot of concepts that don't quite fully comprehend yet. Will do more research and study about it.
3. **2022-11-23** - Skipped a day to take a breather because I felt that my brain had information overload. First time being a SPEAKER for a space today hosted by avie-dev! Thank you for the opportunity! There were a lot of listeners and it was a nice way to start into the tech world (I guess). I have written a Hangman game within the Replit website but really had to look at the solution for assistance in the flow logic of the program. I think I got it but I still have to review the needed concepts (really bad). I also found out I can't rebase to upstream if I have "uncommitted" changes. So I guess I have to save this first, push and ask for a PR.
4. **2022-11-24** - Proceeded with day 40 of the 100 Days Coding challenge in Replit. Finally learned how to create a basic dictionary and access and print out its data by creating a simple contact card form asking the user to input their own information, store into a dictionary and print out using f strings.
