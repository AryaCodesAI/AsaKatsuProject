7. **2022-12-12** - It has been a while since I last pushed something into this repository but it is good to be back! A lot have happened BUT I am so glad I am back on track! I am now on Day 51 of the 100 Days of code and it was really refreshing to relearn the knowledge you have learned before. I just finished coding a while ago and I am ready to tackle Day 52 tomorrow! So for now, I will just review my previous codes and see which parts I till don't understand. JLPT N1 was really difficult. Not expecting anything but I know I did what I can. I can take up studying other languages now. Cheerio!
8. **2022-12-16** - I am now on Day 55 of the 100 Days of Code and I am feeling excited to be able to finish it soon! I have to double my time in studying because I feel like my pace is slow. I learned how to auto-save and auto-read (auto-load) a file, organize data with a little bit of calculation, create a program to backup files into a path and reading (loading) CSV files into a program and manipulating data to display it as a readable output. There is a month and a few days to go so I'll probably finish this right away by doing two at a time instead of just one. Will also do supplemental reading.
