7. **2022-12-12** - It has been a while since I last pushed something into this repository but it is good to be back! A lot have happened BUT I am so glad I am back on track! I am now on Day 51 of the 100 Days of code and it was really refreshing to relearn the knowledge you have learned before. I just finished coding a while ago and I am ready to tackle Day 52 tomorrow! So for now, I will just review my previous codes and see which parts I still don't understand. JLPT N1 was really difficult. Not expecting anything but I know I did what I can. I can take up studying other languages now. Cheerio!
