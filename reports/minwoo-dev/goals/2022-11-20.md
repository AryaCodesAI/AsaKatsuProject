## Log

1. **2022-11-20** - First day, created a branch minwoo from main branch develop of the AsaKatsu Project. Gonna complete at least one pull request today. Ticked the completed days so far of the 100 Days of Code challenge.
2. **2022-11-21** - Second day of using GitHub, had trouble updating my local copy (fork) of the main branch so it will be the same as the main, used merge upstream command to update; will look more into the commands used in this platform. Completed the day 38 of the 100 days coding challenge and I could pretty much say I still have a lot of concepts that don't quite fully comprehend yet. Will do more research and study about it.
