# How to Contribute
0. Set your goal and break it into smaller chunks.

For example you want to read 4 books in one month. Break it down to “Read one book per week”, or smaller, “Read xy chapter per day”.

Be sure that your goal is **SMART**.
- **S**pecific (simple, sensible, significant).
- **M**easurable (meaningful, motivating).
- **A**chievable (agreed, attainable).
- **R**elevant (reasonable, realistic and resourced, results-based).
- **T**ime bound (time-based, time limited, time/cost limited, timely, time-sensitive).

1. [Fork](https://github.com/avie-dev/AsaKatsuProject/fork) this repository.
2. Create an issue stating your goal. You can use the set goal template or create your own format. Feel free.
3. Create a new branch with this format: asakatsu/<github_handle>
   - It is advisable to have only one branch. Work one thing at a time.
   - If you need another branch, aside from goal setting, you can create one
      - feature/your_proposal
      - bugfix/your_proposal

4. Create your folder inside **reports**. And then create a subfolder like the one in the image below.

5. Create a PR everytime you update the log (the txt file). 
   - **If you are ready to merge the PR, put a tag [Ready to Merge]**    
6. You can also post the what is inside the txt file in Twitter with the tag #AsaKatsu if you want. This is optional.
7. Close the issue when you're done with the goal.
