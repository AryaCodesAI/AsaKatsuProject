# About AsaKatsu Project
A project where you can keep track of your goal's progress, and contribute to open source in the same time.

*AsaKatsu* is a Japanese term for waking up a little early to do something productive, in line with a goal.
For example; read 4 books per month, do 100 days challenge, etc.

In this project, everyone who will commit will have to do a thing or two every morning and log the progress here.
